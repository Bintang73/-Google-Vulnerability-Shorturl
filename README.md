Here I will explain about the google url short bug.
Domain name: g*co
Type: Redirect Urls
Levels: low-medium

In the first image, I analyze traffic on google short urls.
I use fiddler to manipulate request traffic.
You can use burpsuite or something else.
-
In the second image, it is clear that the g*co url is trusted and only
Only Google products can use this URL.
-
What's the danger? this could be for web phishing or manipulating someone, for being too trusting
on the g*co domain, namely from Google's own domain.
Users are not aware that google short urls point to non-google products.
-
Example of a manipulated url:
https://g.co/kgs/3xU68p
